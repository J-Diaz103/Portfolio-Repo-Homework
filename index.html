                            I am 26 years old, I’ve lived in California since I was 7 before that I lived in mexico. I enjoy 
                            learning, traveling, trying new food and making things. I spend a lot of time watching videos 
                            trying to learn new skills , and make new things. I enjoy traveling with my fiance. We've traveled 
                            to a few different places and would love to visit some more specially national parks. I enjoy 
                            cooking mostly  because I get to eat it afterwards.
