                        <p >
                            I am 26 years old, I’ve lived in California since I was 7 before that I lived in mexico. I enjoy 
                            learning, traveling, trying new food and making things. I spend a lot of time watching videos 
                            trying to learn new skills , and make new things. I enjoy traveling with my fiance. We've traveled 
                            to a few different places and would love to visit some more specially national parks. I enjoy 
                            cooking mostly  because I get to eat it afterwards.

                                My skills at the moment are mainly in the veterinary field.
                                A  few skills are that I can take Radiographs, perform Dental Prophylaxis, 
                                and I can monitor a patient under anesthesia.

                                I am acquiring new skills in  Full stack WebDevelopment.
                                Currently I am learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
                                In the upcoming months I will be expanding my skill sets as 
                                I learn how to use and apply these programming languages and others that 
                                I have yet to learn.
